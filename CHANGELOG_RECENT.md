**Author:** Erik Burns

**Message:**
Generate comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md and DESIGN.md documentation

- Created ARCHITECTURE.md: High-level system design, core concepts, data flow
- Created DESIGN.md: Implementation details, file structure, code patterns
- Updated context-sync.js to maintain both documents (replaces SYSTEM.md)
- Updated agent-chat.js to include both docs in agent context

Agents now have complete codebase understanding for design discussions.
