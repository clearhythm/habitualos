    <h2 class="section-title">Built to be used, not demoed</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">
      Most agentic AI exists as demos or developer previews. HabitualOS is different:
      I'm the primary user, and these tools handle real daily work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The premise is simple: the best way to understand agentic AI is to live with it.
      When an agent manages your actual task load, the gaps in design quality become
      immediately visible. When AI supports your real relationship dynamics, the failure
      modes that don't show up in benchmarks surface quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      HabitualOS is a personal R&D platform with two deployed systems. It's also
      becoming a shared infrastructure for building agentic apps focused on human
      empowerment and internal growth — which is why it's a monorepo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work spans multi-agent orchestration, conversational UX patterns, structured
      agent signal protocols, and the problem of building AI systems that treat humans
      as collaborators rather than endpoints.

          <p>
            A multi-agent system that handles the operational overhead of daily work.
            Multiple specialized agents manage different concerns: task creation and
            scheduling, practice tracking, progress monitoring, and daily check-ins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system uses a structured signal protocol for agent output — agents don't
            just respond with text, they emit typed signals like <code>GENERATE_ACTIONS</code>
            (create a scheduled task), <code>GENERATE_ASSET</code> (produce a deliverable now),
            or <code>STORE_MEASUREMENT</code> (record a check-in data point). This keeps agent
            behavior constrained and auditable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The practice component tracks habit consistency and generates insights from
            patterns over time. The Do component handles task management through
            conversational interfaces — you describe what needs to happen, agents
            structure it into scheduled actions.

            A conversational journaling tool built for two people navigating complex
            relational dynamics together. Captures relationship moments through chat
            (no forms), identifies patterns across history, and offers AI-assisted
            reflection prompts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Named with intention. The whimsy is a deliberate design choice: AI in
            intimate contexts needs a different sensibility than enterprise software.
            Warmth and playfulness aren't decoration — they're part of what makes
            the tool approachable for emotionally charged material.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is active territory in wellness tech. Relationship support apps are
            an underexplored application of agentic AI, and building one in a real
            relationship produces signal that a mock dataset can't.

          Agents surface options and handle operational overhead.
