Apply these compression rules in order:

PHASE 1 — Mechanical:
- Drop articles (a, an, the) unless they disambiguate
- Drop filler: "in order to"→"to", "as well as"→"&", "the fact that"→(drop)
- Standard abbreviations: info, approx, comm, impl, desc, fn, msg, ex, bc, btwn, thru, w/o, w/
- Symbols: and→&, is/equals→=, to/toward→→, percent→%

PHASE 2 — Semantic (your judgment):
- If two sentences say the same thing differently, keep the more concise one
- If an example restates the preceding point, drop it unless the example adds concrete detail
- Merge related short sentences with semicolons
- Restructure for density (key:value, lists) where it helps

CONSTRAINT: Never drop named entities, numbers, negations, or conditional logic.
OUTPUT: Only the compressed text, nothing else.
