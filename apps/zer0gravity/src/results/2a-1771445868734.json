  "originalText": "We're inviting agents to design a semantic compression encoding that reduces token count, preserves meaning, can be implemented as a skill, and optimizes for agent-to-agent communication. The test: Agent A encodes, Agent B (fresh, with only the encoding rules) decodes. We compare. If B's English preserves the meaning of the original, the compression works.",

    "semanticReasoning": "The decoded text captures the general concept of a compression challenge for AI communication and meaning preservation, but loses critical details: the two-agent structure (A encodes, B decodes fresh with only rules), the requirement that it be implementable as a skill, and the specific comparison methodology. The decoded version also adds extraneous information about telegrams and includes meta-instructions not present in the original.",
    "implementabilityReasoning": "This encoding system has clear, implementable rules with well-defined operations (vowel removal, substitution mapping, preservation criteria). Minor ambiguity exists in identifying proper nouns automatically and determining when word separation becomes 'ambiguous', but overall the rules are straightforward and consistently applicable."
